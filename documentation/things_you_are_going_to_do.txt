- File integrity monitor

- Uses Python (most likely)

- It monitors the files in given directories by monitoring their hash-values. If changes are spotted, the user is informed of the change in real-time.

- Will have a UI, however, will at the very least work on command line. Depends on, whether I have the time.

- Can be used to assure that the files have not been maliciously modified or damaged.
